In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its modern counterpart, Automatic Reference Counting or ARC).  Consider the scenario where an object is created and passed to a method, but the method doesn't retain it. When the method returns, the object's retain count drops to zero, even if it's still needed elsewhere, causing unexpected crashes. This is often missed because the compiler doesn't issue explicit warnings, and the crash may not happen immediately or consistently.

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod { 
  NSString *string = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
  self.myString = string; // Correct, self retains string
}

- (void)anotherMethod { 
  NSString *anotherString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"World"];
  [self useString:anotherString]; // Wrong, the object is not retained, and will be deallocated
}

- (void)useString:(NSString *)str {
   // ... use str here ...
}
@end
```
In `anotherMethod`, the allocated string is not retained and is deallocated before the method completes, causing an error later on when accessing `anotherString`.
