The solution involves ensuring proper object retention within the method.  If the object needs to persist after the method call, either it needs to be retained explicitly (in manual retain-release scenarios) or added as a strong property of the class. 

Here is the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod { 
  NSString *string = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
  self.myString = string; // Correct, self retains string
}

- (void)anotherMethod { 
  NSString *anotherString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"World"];
  [self useString:anotherString]; // Corrected
}

- (void)useString:(NSString *)str {
   self.myString = str; // Retain str or add another strong property to retain it.
   // ... use str here ...
}
@end
```
By adding a strong property to the object,  the `str` is retained for as long as needed, preventing premature deallocation.
